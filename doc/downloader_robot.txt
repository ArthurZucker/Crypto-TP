# RML TYPE SYSTEM
# ===============
#
# RML is strongly typed, and the type discipline is checked statically at
# compile-time. The special value None has type "nothing" (it denotes the absence
# of value). We have the following rules:
#
# For all types R and S,
#
#     "anything" is a subtype of R,
#     R          is a subtype of "something",
#     "nothing"  is a subtype of "R maybe",
#     R          is a subtype of "R maybe",
#     "R list"   is a subtype of "S list"      iff    R is a subtype of S,
#     "R maybe"  is a subtype of "S maybe"     iff    R is a subtype of S.
#
#
# (Recall that S is a subtype of T if a value of type S can always be used in
# place of a value of type T). Keen observers will have noticed that RML uses
# non-structural subtyping.
#
# The programmer must declare the type of all variables (using the "let"
# instruction). New values can simply be assigned to already-declared variables.
# When a value is assigned to a variable, it must have a compatible type.
#
# The base types are string, data, int and bool. The + operator works with ints,
# strings, data and list (it concatenates them). The -, *, /, <, > operators
# require int arguments. The equality comparison operator == and != work with any
# type. The :: operator (which appends an item at the end of a list) requires a
# list and a compatible item. The ^ operator (XOR) only works on data.
#
# In other terms:
#
#      +  : (int, int) -> int
#         | (string, string) -> string
#         | (data, data) -> data
#         | (R list, S list) -> R list    iff S is a subtype of R
#         | (R list, S list) -> S list    iff R is a subtype of S
#
# -, *, / : (int, int) -> int
#       ^ : (data, data) -> data
#     ::  : (R list, S) -> R list         iff S a subtype of R
#
#    <, > : (int, int) -> bool
# and, or : (bool, bool) -> bool
#     not : (bool) -> bool
#  ==, != : (something, something) -> bool
#
# The type system checks that arguments have compatible types in function calls,
# and that the return values of function have a compatible type. Without argument,
# the "return" statement is equivalent to "return None". The special "panic"
# statement is equivalent to a "return" with a special value of type "anything".
#
# The "case" statement is specifically designed to deal with "R maybe" values ; in
# the "Some <id>" branch, the name <id> is bound to a value of type R, which is
# thus guaranteed not to be None.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
extern def print (message : string) -> nothing.

def main(action : string maybe, direction : string maybe, item : string maybe) -> nothing {
  print("I'm just another BRICK in the wall !");

  # At least this one won't bother us anymore -- CB, KH, FM, QM & DV.
  panic
